#What is the Community Bookstore?
It is an initiative to build a final product for the community by the community. A Drupal Distribution using Backbone.js to resolve a very specific problem: access to knowledge.

#What are the objectives of Community Bookstore?
Provide a website to enable people to exchange books for a price or for free (depending of the good karma of seller or donors).

The tool will work best for instance for a parent with kids from K - 12 Schools or college students all the way through their undergrad and post doctorate.

The website will have a high impact in the community in areas like:

Ecology (Less books printed, more books reused and more books recycled at their end of life)
Knowledge (Enable to share education for free or a reduced price)
Economy (Less moeny is required to buy books, this money could be invested in other areas like clothing or food)
How I can contribute? 
Subcribe to DrupalCamp CR 2013 and send an email to camp@drupalcr.org informing us that you want to be part of this event.

#What skills I need to Contribute?
Community Bookstore will use the whole areas available in the Drupal broad spectrum of skills, and we expect the percentaje of effort will be distributed in the following way.

#What will the Community Bookstore look like?
These are the wireframes, but they are not set in stone. Contributors will be able to evaluate, pitch in and impact the project, allowing them to decide changes in the features.
